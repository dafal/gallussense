> üß™‚ú® This is a vibe-coded project: built with fun, curiosity, backyard audio chaos, and a lot of rooster spirit.

# üêî GallusSense

**GallusSense** is a real-time rooster call detection system built to work with audio streams‚Äîespecially RTSP streams from IP cameras. It uses audio signal processing, MFCC features, and a trained machine learning model to detect rooster calls ("cocorico!").

The project consists of two main components:

- **Backend** ‚Äì Captures and analyzes audio in real time using `ffmpeg` and `librosa`, then uses a machine learning model to detect rooster calls. Detections are logged into a local SQLite database.
  
- **Frontend** ‚Äì A playful and interactive Streamlit app that displays detection events in a fun and visual way. It provides real-time feedback, sound wave previews, stats, and animation when a rooster is detected.

## üöÄ Features

- üì° **Real-time audio capture** from any RTSP stream using `ffmpeg`
- üéß **MFCC-based audio analysis** powered by `librosa` for robust feature extraction
- ü§ñ **Rooster call detection** using a pre-trained `RandomForestClassifier` model
- ‚úÖ **Confidence-based logging** ‚Äì only detections above a configurable threshold are stored
- üóÉÔ∏è **Detection history** stored in a local SQLite database with timestamps
- üîä **Optional audio clip saving** ‚Äì automatically stores audio segments when a rooster is detected
- üì∏ **Optional spectrogram export** for visual inspection or data science fun
- üîÅ **Automatic `ffmpeg` recovery** ‚Äì restarts the stream if audio freezes or drops
- üéõÔ∏è **ASCII waveform previews** right in the console, just for the nerdy joy of it
- üìä **Fun and visual Streamlit dashboard** ‚Äì real-time stats by hour, day, and more quirky analytics to enjoy your rooster data in style

## üß† Model Details

GallusSense uses a lightweight yet effective machine learning approach to detect rooster calls based on audio signal characteristics.

### üîç Training Pipeline

The default model was trained using a combination of:
- üìπ **Rooster audio samples** recorded directly from the author's backyard
- üéß **Non-rooster sounds** extracted from the ESC-50 dataset (environmental recordings)

The training workflow includes:
1. **Audio preprocessing** with `librosa`:
   - Resampling to 22,050 Hz
   - Normalization
   - MFCC extraction (40 coefficients)
2. **Feature aggregation** by averaging over the time axis
3. **Binary classification** using a `RandomForestClassifier` with class balancing

### ‚öñÔ∏è Performance & Generalization

> The model performs very well in its original environment, but its generalization to other contexts (regions, audio devices) hasn't been thoroughly tested.

- ‚úÖ Excellent detection accuracy in the trained backyard setup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Occasional false positives from ambulance sirens and motorcycles due to similar acoustic patterns

For better accuracy in other settings, retraining with local audio samples is recommended.

### üß™ Train Your Own Model

A ready-to-use **Jupyter notebook (`train_model.ipynb`)** is included in the repository to help you:
- Load your own rooster and non-rooster samples
- Extract MFCC features
- Train and export a new `.pkl` model

This makes it easy to adapt GallusSense to your own environment in just a few steps!

Tr√®s bien ! On peut cr√©er une **section claire et pratique** pour le d√©ploiement avec Docker, incluant :

1. üîß Liste des variables d‚Äôenvironnement n√©cessaires (extraites de ton backend)
2. üê≥ Commandes simples pour lancer les conteneurs
3. ‚öôÔ∏è Un exemple `docker-compose.yml`
4. üöÄ Bonus : quelques id√©es pour aller plus loin si tu veux am√©liorer le setup


## üê≥ Running with Docker

GallusSense is designed to run easily using Docker containers for both backend processing and the frontend dashboard.

### üß© Docker Images

Prebuilt images are available on Docker Hub:
